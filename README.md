More solutions. More insights. morPy.

Multiprocessing aided Python framework with integrated logging to a database with the aim to document debugging and rolling out software that may be used in GxP environments.


This framework is still in beta. The development goals to v1.0 are:
1) Supporting Multiprocessing including concurrent file I/O and benchmarking.
2) Making more use of object oriented programming with a number of functions, which already are working.
3) Making use of decorators.

Feel free to comment, share and support this project.
