# morPy
More solutions. More insights. morPy.

This framework is still in beta. The development goals to v1.0 are:
1) Supporting Multiprocessing including concurrent file I/O and benchmarking.
2) Making more use of object oriented programming with a number of functions, which already are working.
3) Making use of decorators.

Feel free to comment, share and support this project.
